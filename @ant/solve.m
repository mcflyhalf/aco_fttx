%%% Methodology of getting the solution to the Lch and Lsc? 
% Given parameters of a world, determine the Links between the homes and closures and splitters
% Apply cosntraints to find viable options using the Dist Matrices
% Compute proabilities to detrmine links but consider constraints
% Example - Constraint 1: If Distance within matrix is greater than X, replace element with zero
% Constraint 2: A closure can only have a maximum of x links
% Constraint 3: All homes must be linke dto a closure and if a aclosure is linked to a home it has to be linked to a splitters
